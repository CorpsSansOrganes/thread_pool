C++11-\/compatible semaphore implementation. Semaphore is a signalling device, used for synchronisation between threads, as it restricts access to critical code sections until a signal is received. The centre piece of a semaphore is a counter. When a thread wants to pass the semaphore, it checks the counter.

C++11-\/compatible semaphore implementation. Semaphore is a signalling device, used for synchronisation between threads, as it restricts access to critical code sections until a signal is received. The centre piece of a semaphore is a counter. When a thread wants to pass the semaphore, it checks the counter.

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item If the counter is positive, it decrements it and passes.
\item If the counter is zero, the thread will be blocked until the semaphore is incremented by another thread.
