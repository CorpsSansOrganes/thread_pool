By providing a dedicated object for multithreaded operations, it reduces the overhead cost of creating and destorying threads. It also alleviates the headace of managing synchronisation between threads.

Additional features of this implementation\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Supporting asynchronous return values from tasks.
\item Add or remove threads at runtime.
\item Pause and unpause the thread pool.
