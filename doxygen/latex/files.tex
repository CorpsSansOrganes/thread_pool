\item\contentsline{section}{include/\mbox{\hyperlink{semaphore_8hpp}{semaphore.\+hpp}} \\*C++11-\/compatible semaphore implementation. Semaphore is a signalling device, used for synchronisation between threads, as it restricts access to critical code sections until a signal is received. The centre piece of a semaphore is a counter. When a thread wants to pass the semaphore, it checks the counter }{\pageref{semaphore_8hpp}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{include/\mbox{\hyperlink{thread__pool_8hpp}{thread\+\_\+pool.\+hpp}} \\*Thread Pool is a design pattern offering an A\+PI for distributing tasks among a group of worker threads. It is used to simplify performing tasks concurrently }{\pageref{thread__pool_8hpp}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{include/\mbox{\hyperlink{waitable__queue_8hpp}{waitable\+\_\+queue.\+hpp}} \\*Thread-\/safe queue, allowing for multiple threads to insert new items, remove existing items or wait until a new item becomes available to consume }{\pageref{waitable__queue_8hpp}}{}
